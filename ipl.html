        <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) (also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons) is a men's Twenty20
            (T20) cricket
            league that is annually held in India and contested by ten city-based franchise teams.[3][4] The BCCI
            founded the league
            in 2007. The competition is usually held in summer between March and May every year. It has an exclusive
            window in the
            ICC Future Tours Programme due to fewer international cricket tours happening during IPL seasons
            worldwide.[5]

            The IPL is the most-popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it was ranked sixth by average attendance
            among all
            sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8]
            Other Indian
            sports leagues have been established based on the success of the IPL.[a][11][12][13] The brand value of the
            league in
            2022 was ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[14] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore
            (US$140
            million) to the GDP of the economy of India.[15] In December 2022, IPL became a decacorn valued at US$10.9
            billion,
            registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a
            report by
            consulting firm D and P Advisory.[16] Its 2023 final was the most streamed live event on internet with 3.2
            Cr or 32
            million viewers.[17]

            In 2023 the league sold its media rights for the period of 2023–2027 for US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star
            Sports,[18]
            making the IPL's value per match $13.4 million.[19] As of 2023, there have been sixteen seasons of the
            tournament. The
            current champions are Chennai Super Kings, who won the season 2023 after defeating Gujarat Titans in the
            final at the
            Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.[20]</p>
